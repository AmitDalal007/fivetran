                                <p className="_unip pt-4">This Fivetran Master Subscription Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made between Fivetran, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Fivetran”) and the party (“Customer”) that subscribes for the Services, as defined below. Between Fivetran and each Customer the Agreement consists of these terms, each signed order form or online enrollment (including any notes, pricing or other terms listed therein) (the “Order Form”), including any exhibits, and any updates or amendments to each of the foregoing. This Agreement is effective as of the date of Customer’s initial Order Form (the “Effective Date”). By executing the initial Order Form or accessing the Services, Customer agrees to all the terms set forth below. Customer’s usage of the Services is governed by Fivetran’s Service Consumption Table at <a href="/" className="_unilb"> https://fivetran.com/legal/credit-consumption</a>.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">In certain cases Fivetran may provide a trial version of the Services. In that case each Customer consents to this Agreement by clicking Agree or using the Services. If Customer and Fivetran execute a subsequent agreement regarding commercial use of the Services, its terms will supersede the terms here to the extent of any conflict.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</p>

Fivetran will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Customer the data pipeline management services identified on each Order Form and the technical support on <span className="_lglultxt">Exhibit A</span>, and Customer may have use and access such services, each according to the terms of the Agreement.

If Customer is paying by credit card, Customer represents and warrants that it has the right to use the credit card provided and grants Fivetran the right to provide the credit card information, including the credit card number, its expiration date and billing address, to third parties for the purposes of facilitating payment transactions.

Inquiries should be directed to Fivetran’s customer support department. Without limiting its other remedies, Fivetran may suspend Services for nonpayment of fees.</p>

Fivetran will notify Customer in connection with any renewal.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">7.2 <span className="_lglultxt">Termination for Cause</span>. In addition to any other remedies it may have, (A) either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party (i) materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after written notice describing the breach; or (ii) files for bankruptcy or is the subject of an involuntary filing in bankruptcy (in the latter case, which filing is not discharged within 60 days) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or a trustee is appointed over all or a substantial portion of its assets and (B) Fivetran may additionally terminate this Agreement and the Services (or any portion of the Services) (i) immediately and without notice if it has reason to believe Customer is violating Section 2 of this Agreement; or (ii) following notice, in the case a Customer has no more Credits available and has not transferred data using the Services for a consecutive 90 day period (each, “<span className="_lglultxt">Termination for Cause</span>”).

If, due to a claim of infringement, the Services are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by Fivetran to be infringing, Fivetran may, at its option and expense (x) replace or modify the Services to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (y) obtain for Customer a license to continue using the Services, or (z) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement and provide Customer a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the Services.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">9.2 <span className="_lglultxt">By Customer</span>. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless (by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Fivetran) Fivetran and its Indemnified Parties against all liabilities, damages, fines, judgments, settlements, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) alleging that the Customer Data or its use has infringed the rights of or otherwise caused harm to a third party, or violated applicable law; <span className="_lglultxt">provided</span> that in any such case Fivetran gives written notice of the Claim to Customer promptly after Fivetran becomes aware of such Claim, and Customer’s indemnity obligations will be waived only if and to the extent that its ability to conduct the defense are materially prejudiced by this failure to give notice.</p>

If Fivetran does not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then Customer may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of its monthly service fees.

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Applicable Monthly Service Fees</span>” -  means the total fees actually paid by Customer for a Service that are applied to the month in which a Service Credit is owed. For Data Delivery Services, this will be each individual service affected by Downtime, for example a specific connector like Salesforce, or Mailchimp.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Monthly Pipeline Minutes</span>” - All of the minutes that a single Fivetran pipeline is turned on or activated during the month of a Downtime.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">"<span className="_lglbtxt">Service Credit</span>" - is the percentage of the Applicable Monthly Service Fees credited to Customerfollowing Fivetran’s claim approval.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Service Credit Percentage</span>” means for every hour of Downtime, the percentage of the Applicable Monthly Service Fees applied back to the Customer in the form of Service Credits.</p>

                                <h3 className="_legalh3 _unitxt pt-4">Terms<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h3>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">Claims<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Customer must submit claims to Fivetran customer support at <a href="/" className="_unilb">support.fivetran.com</a> along with all information necessary for Fivetran to validate each claim, including: (i) a detailed description of the incident; (ii) information regarding the time and duration of the Downtime; (iii) the number and location(s) of affected users (if applicable); and (iv) descriptions of Customer’s attempts to resolve the incident.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Fivetran must receive the claim within two months of the end of the month in which the incident occurred. Fivetran will evaluate all reasonably available information and make a good faith determination of whether a Service Credit is owed. Fivetran will use commercially reasonable efforts to process claims within 45 days of receipt. Customer must be in compliance with the Agreement to be eligible for Credits. If a Service Credit is owed to Customer, Fivetran will apply the Service Credit to Customer’s subsequent service term or to any additional Services added during the current term.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">If Customer experiences Downtime for multiple Services, they must submit a separate claim for each Service. For example, if Customer experienced Downtime for both Salesforce Data Replication and MySQL Data Replication, Customer could be eligible for two separate Service Credits for Data Delivery (one for each Service), by submitting two claims under this SLA. Service Credits are Customer’s sole remedy for performance or availability issues for any Service under the Agreement and this SLA.</p>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">Service Credits<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Service Credits are Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any performance or availability issues for any Service under the Agreement and this SLA. Customer may not unilaterally offset Applicable Monthly Service Fees for any performance or availability issues.</p>

                                <p className="_unip _legalph pt-3">Core Services</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Service Credits for Core Services that are given for Downtime for Core Services experienced may not be redeemed for cash and may not exceed 25% of the total monthly fees paid to Fivetran in the month that the incident occurred, and may not exceed 10% of annualized fees paid for the current term. These lower limits are due to the fact that Data Delivery services can still perform while the API, or Web Application are experiencing downtime. Service Credits will be credited to Customer’s account in the form of Fivetran Credits at Customer’s current plan level.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Note: With Fivetran, not all Core Services are directly correlated with Data Delivery Services. For example, Fivetran’s Web Application, and APIs could be down and Fivetran could still be delivering data on schedule. In addition, Fivetran’s replication servers could be available, but data is not being delivered due to load errors, source API issues, etc.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">If one Core Service has Downtime, Customer will receive a Service Credit as outlined above even if the other Core Services are working. If more than one Core Service is down concurrently, the Customer will receive the same Service Credit, not multiple credits.</p>

                                <p className="_unip _legalph pt-3">Data Delivery</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Service Credits for Data Delivery may not be redeemed for cash, and may not exceed 50% of the total monthly fees paid to Fivetran for the affected connector in the month that the incident occurred. Service Credits will be credited to Customer’s account in the form of Fivetran credits at Customer’s current plan level.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Downtime</span>” - When a Core Service, described below in the table in Monthly Uptime Percentage, is unavailable. For example, for Fivetran’s Web Application, if a user tries to access it and receives a 404 page, or the application will not load it is considered unavailable. Downtime is measured in minutes.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">"<span className="_lglbtxt">Maximum Available Monthly Minutes</span>" - is the absolute maximum number of Monthly Pipeline Minutes across all of Customer’s Services, that is not to exceed the total minutes in an average month (43,000).</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">For example, if Customer has two pipeline services, Salesforce, which ran for a total of 30,000 minutes, and Marketo, which ran for 23,000, Customer’s Maximum Available Monthly Minutes would equal 30,000.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">"<span className="_lglbtxt">Monthly Uptime Percentage</span>” -  for Core Services is calculated as Maximum Available Monthly Minutes less Downtime divided by the Maximum Available Monthly Minutes. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">MONTHLY UPTIME % = (MAXIMUM AVAILABLE MINUTES - DOWNTIME) / MAXIMUM AVAILABLE MONTHLY MINUTES</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">”<span className="_lglbtxt">Service Credit Calculation</span>”  - If a service is considered to be down longer than the Monthly Uptime Percentage, and if Customer has purchased Fivetran’s Uptime SLA, Customer will accrue Service Credits. Service Credits for Core Services is represented by the following formula:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">SERVICE CREDITS = DOWNTIME * APPLICABLE MONTHLY SERVICE FEES * SERVICE CREDIT PERCENTAGE</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Example Calculation:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">In April, Customer uses a total of 100 Fivetran Credits, costing a total of $100 (Applicable Monthly Service Fees). During that month Fivetran’s Web Application was unavailable for 4.27 hours due to a server failure. For every hour of the 4.27 hours of Downtime that Core Services experienced, Customer is credited back 1% of the $100 against Customer’s usage of Fivetran services in May or future months for a total of $4.27.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">$4.27 (Service Credits) = 4.27 Hours (Downtime for Core Services ) * $100 (Application Monthly Service Fees) * 1% (Service Credit Percentage)</p>

A Data Delivery SLA is a guarantee that Fivetran will load data on a regular interval, which is defined as the combined total time of the Normal Update Time added onto the Allowed Downtime Interval.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Data Delivery Services</span>” – means any data connectors that are loading data through Customer’s Fivetran account.

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">For a Service to be covered by this Data Delivery SLA, each table from a data source must be proven capable of syncing to Customer’s target warehouse by: successfully syncing the initial data load, and then successfully syncing the fewer times of 48 incremental successful loads (approximately 2 days of syncs based on average 1 hour sync intervals) or 5 consecutive days of incremental successful loads.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Downtime</span>” - Downtime for Data Delivery will begin to accrue after the service has not been successfully loading data into Customers target destination for the length of the Normal Update Time plus the Allowed Downtime Interval. The Allowed Downtime Interval for Data Delivery Services is 12 hours + the connector’s Normal Update Time, which can be found on a rolling 30 day average within the Fivetran dashboard.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Example Calculation:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">For example, if the affected connector’s Normal Update Time was 2 hours, then the Allowed Downtime Interval would be 12 + 2 = 14 hours, and the Customer would not start accruing Downtime until 14 hours after data loading stopped. In order to be eligible for downtime, the connection must (a) be completely broken / not loading data at all, or (b) more than 15% of tables do not load during the Normal Update Time for the Service.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">”<span className="_lglbtxt">Monthly Uptime Percentage</span>” -  for Data Delivery Services is calculated as Monthly Pipeline Minutes for the affected connector less Downtime divided by Monthly Pipeline Minutes for that affected connector. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">MONTHLY UPTIME % = (MONTHLY PIPELINE MINUTES - DOWNTIME) / MONTHLY PIPELINE MINUTES</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Downtime for Data Delivery is monitored via Fivetran logs at fivetran.com/dashboard or via the Fivetran Log Connector or via Fivetran’s log service that exports service logs to Customer’s designated log service, such as AWS Cloudwatch.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Service Credit Calculation</span>” - If a service is considered to be down longer than the Monthly Uptime Percentage, if Customer has purchased Fivetran’s Uptime SLA, Customer will accrue Service Credits. Service Credits are calculated as:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">SERVICE CREDITS = DOWNTIME * APPLICABLE MONTHLY SERVICE FEES * SERVICE CREDIT PERCENTAGE</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">Example Calculation:</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">In April, Customer consumed 417 Fivetran Credits to load data for Customer’s Salesforce connector service, costing $417 (Applicable Monthly Service Fees). During that month Customers Salesforce connector experienced a loading error, and was unable to load data for 16.7 hours past the Allowed Downtime interval and the Normal Update Time. For every hour of the 16.7 hours of Downtime experienced for Customer’s Salesforce Connector, Customer is credited back 0.25% of the $417 against Customer’s usage of Fivetran services in May or future months for a total of $17.40.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3 fst-italic">$17.40 (Service Credits) = 16.7 Hours (Downtime) * $417 (Application Monthly Service Fees) * 0.25% (Service Credit Percentage)</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-3">“<span className="_lglbtxt">Normal Update Time</span>” – the average time between successful syncs over the previous 14 days, as specified on the connector page within the Fivetran application dashboard. Normal Update Time is not available until there have been 48 successful incremental loads.</p>

These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to the Services such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at a Fivetran website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Services) and product information. Fivetran may also use some of these Data Tools in emails sent from Fivetran and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.</p>

Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting usage data through Data Tools. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other web sites.

If you are visiting such sites, many browsers will allow you to set Do Not Track signals so that third parties know that you do not want to be tracked.</p>

Fivetran will maintain an up-to-date list of its sub-processors on its website, which it will update with details of any change in sub-processors at least 10 days prior to any such change, thereby giving Customer the opportunity to object to such changes.

Fivetran will notify Customer without undue delay after Fivetran’s discovery or notification of Breach by email to the notice email address on the signature page below, or Customer’s principal contact for the Services if none is provided. Fivetran will further take reasonably necessary measures to remedy or mitigate the effects of the Breach and will keep Customer informed of all material developments in connection with the Breach.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">5.3 <span className="_lglultxt">Amendment; Enforcement of Rights</span>.

                                <p className="_unip _legalph pt-3">3.1 Documentation and compliance.</p>

                                <p className="_unip _legalph pt-3">3.2 Notification and Transparency.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Fivetran, where required by the Standard Contractual Clauses, to notify the competent supervisory authority, shall first provide Customer with the details of the notification, permitting Customer to have prior written input into the relevant notification, where Customer so desires to do, and without delaying the timing of the notification unduly. </p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">(b) For purposes of Clause 8.2 – Module 1, Clause 8.3 – Module 2 and Clause 15.1(a), the Parties agree and acknowledge that it may not be possible for Fivetran to make the appropriate communications to data subjects and accordingly, Customer shall (following notification by the Data Importer) have the option to be the party who makes any communication to the data subject, and Vendor shall provide the level of assistance set out in the DPA.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4"><span className="_legalph">3.4 Enforcement</span>. The Data Exporter may enforce the terms of the Standard Contractual Clauses against the Data Importer (and vice versa), provided however, that the Parties agree that any valid legal action, suit, claim or proceedings must be brought by Fivetran on behalf of the relevant Data Exporter/Data Importer (as applicable), where such Data Exporter/Data Importer would otherwise have the right to bring such claim directly against Customer if it were a party to the Agreement (each a “<span className="_legalph">Relevant Claim</span>”), unless the applicable Data Protection Laws to which the relevant Data Exporter/Data Importer is subject requires that the relevant Data Exporter/Data Importer itself bring or be a party to such Relevant Claim.  The Standard Contractual Clauses entered into between Customer and Vendor shall only be enforceable against the Customer entity which is party to the Agreement as such Standard Contractual Clauses form an integrated part of the Agreement (including the DPA), which shall form the entire agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data by Vendor. Any such Relevant Claim shall at all times be subject to any aggregate limitation of liability that applies under the Agreement. The existence of more than one claim shall not enlarge this limit.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4"><span className="_legalph">3.5 Signatories</span>. Notwithstanding the fact that the Standard Contractual Clauses are incorporated herein by reference without being signed directly, Fivetran and Customer each agrees that their execution of the Agreement is deemed to constitute its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and that it is duly authorized to do so on behalf of, and to contractually bind, the Data Exporter or Data Importer (as applicable) accordingly.</p>

The Services listed in the Order Form are advisory services Fivetran offers its customers to help them fully utilize the Fivetran platform. Customer agrees that Customer will provide Fivetran with any requested information necessary to provide the Services by the Services Start Date (the “Required Information”). Customer acknowledges that Fivetran’s ability to perform the Services depends on Customer providing the Required Information. For clarity, the Services are advisory in nature and do not include any development services. Fivetran will obtain Customer’s prior written approval to use sub-contractors to provide the Services, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.</li>

For any invoice not paid within thirty (30) days of receipt, Fivetran reserves the right to (a) charge interest of 1.5% per month (or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is lower), and (b) if the Company does not pay an overdue invoice within 5 days of receiving a notice of nonpayment suspend the Services or Customer’s use of the Fivetran platform and terminate this Addendum and the parties’ MSA.</li>

This Addendum is the entire agreement of the parties as it relates to the Services and supersedes all other commitments, negotiations and understandings relating thereto. If any provision of this Addendum is adjudicated to be unenforceable, that provision shall be reinterpreted to be as close to the parties’ intent as legally possible and the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. From time to time Fivetran may modify this Agreement. Sections 4 and 5 shall survive expiration or termination of this Addendum. This Addendum is governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of laws principles.</li>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">What is a Monthly Active Row?<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">Monthly Active Rows (MAR) are similar to total monthly synced rows but are less prone to variation and less prone to outliers. MAR is calculated as the number of distinct primary keys observed by Fivetran in a given Billing Period. Primary Keys are counted separately by Fivetran Account, Destination, and Connector. For clarity, if a distinct Primary Key is synced more than once in a given Billing Period then the distinct primary key counts as only a single Monthly Active Row. For example, a distinct Primary Key synced 30 times during a Billing Period will count as one Monthly Active Row. If a Primary Key is not available, we create a synthetic (hashed) Primary Key to ensure consistent tracking. One exception to this is that we exclude Monthly Active Rows associated with the initial historical sync for each new connector added.</p>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">How does credit consumption work? <a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">Monthly Credits used are determined by the number of Monthly Active Rows within each billing account across that Billing Period. Monthly Credits are consumed based on a diminishing slope: in other words, the more unique data you sync in a Billing Period, the cheaper the incremental cost per unique Monthly Active Row.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">The pricing of your Credits depends on the plan you have selected and whether you are drawing down from an initial Capacity Purchase Plan or paying for supplemental Credits via our On-Demand program. For non-subscription Plans (i.e. Monthly Plans), the pricing of your Credits is based on the prices available on our website, <a href="/" className="_unilb">fivetran.com/pricing</a>.</p>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">Capacity Purchase<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">If you are drawing down from a Capacity Purchase Plan, your credit consumption rates will be determined by the Service Consumption Table outlined below. Capacity Credit Pricing is determined by your Order Form. Purchased Credits may be applied toward any of your Accounts on the Fivetran Service. However, the Service Consumption Table benefits for anything higher volume than is listed below may be applied on an Account by Account basis (and cannot be combined across accounts). Fivetran will provide you with monthly usage, in-arrears via the Fivetran dashboard.</p>

                                <h4 className="_unitxt _legalh4 pt-3">On-Demand<a href="/"><i className="bi bi-link-45deg _lgllink"></i></a></h4>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">On-Demand is a supplemental credit program that occurs automatically for Capacity Purchase plan customers who continue to use the Fivetran Service after depleting their available Capacity Purchase Credits. If you are drawing down Credits from On-Demand, your Credit consumption rates will be determined by the Service Consumption Table and the price per Credit of your Plan. You will not benefit from any capacity discounts for these On-Demand Credits and will be billed for On-Demand usage in-arrears for each Billing Period.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">Rollover of Credits is only applicable to customers with Capacity Purchase accounts, not Monthly Plans. If you do not use the Credits that you purchased during the term of your contract, you can still use them if you renew your subscription. Subscription renewals require a minimum purchase of $1,000 worth of Credits, and when you do so the remaining Credits on your account can be rolled over to the new contract term. If you have a subscription account that is coming to an end, contact your account representative to learn more about Credit rollover.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">We will adjust the use of Fivetran Service Consumption Table by pro-rating your first month’s purchase so you’re not penalized for starting the service mid-month. This helps right-size all of our new customers and ensures that you can start Fivetran easily, at any point in the month, without wasting Credits. For example, if your subscription starts on the 15th and it's a 30-day month, then we will adjust the Credit Consumption rates in the Service Consumption Table by 0.5. The pro-rating will take into account how many days in the month have already passed and the number of actual days in that month. This will be determined by Fivetran in its discretion.</p>

                                <p className="_unip pt-4">If you decide to open multiple Fivetran Accounts, each account will apply the Fivetran Service Consumption Table for the MAR within that Account. You cannot add together the MAR for multiple Accounts and apply this MAR to Fivetran Service Consumption Table to get a more favorable credit consumption rate. However, if you would like to merge multiple Accounts into a single Account with separate destinations, you can reach out to Support through your dashboard or your account representative to get help with this migration. Merging accounts can have significant benefits, especially if the combined accounts have a high MAR usage.</p>
